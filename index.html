            <h3>History</h3><p>I grew up a military brat, moving up and down the east coast. I moved to
                Nebraska in 1992. I attended Doane University and University of Nebraska 
                at Kearney. However, I didn't finish and ended taking up a career in construction,
                more specifically concrete. That lasted almost two decade before I got hurt on the job.

                <br>
                After an amazing recovery, I realized I needed to find a new career more suited to
                my new limitations. I attended University of Nebraska at Omaha and earned my B.S in Management
                Information Systems in 2016. I am now looking to explore web development and as of right now, as you can plainly see,
                am a novice.
